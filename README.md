### Howdy! 👋

My name is Ben Stone(StenBone). I primarily write C++ programs, currently I\'m focused on [stenbone_takes_on_modern_cpp_challenge](https://github.com/StenBone/stenbone_takes_on_modern_cpp_challenge) and [ConwaysGOL](https://github.com/StenBone/ConwaysGOL). The former repository is my adventure through <u>The Modern C++ Challenge</u> by Marius Bancila and the latter is a recreation of Conways Game of Life with C++ and SFML that I am using as a series on my [blog](https://stenbone.io).
I hope you find something cool here and stay a while. Happy Coding! 👨‍💻

-Ben
